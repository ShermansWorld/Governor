# Governor
## Current Version: BETA-1.2.1
An Unofficial Towny Expansion Plugin

Governor is an expansion for towny that gives town leaders additional tools. It also allows for players to claim mayorship of inactive towns. An inactive town is defined as a town that's mayor has been inactive for x amount of days (default is 30). 

Governor is open source, so feel free to download and modify the source code to fit your needs. All I ask is that I am creditied if you intend on deploying a modified version of Governor in a commercial setting. I am currently taking suggestions for additions to Governor, so feel free to reach out!
